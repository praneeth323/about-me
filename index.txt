 Iam a grad student pursuing my major in applied computer science. 

I did my under grad in MVSR engineering college Hyderabad. In my 2nd year along with my friends I created a entertainment website named "cinebucket" which is about reviewing movies and articles related to movies. 

Right now I don't have any plans regarding career. But I am sure by the end of this semester I will get a clear view . 

There is nothing much about my profile.
